# homebrew-os161

[Homebrew] formulae for installing [System/161] and an [OS/161]
cross-compiling toolchain on macOS.

This is a fork of [benesch/homebrew-os161] updated to get it working in 2024.

**Supported versions:**

* System/161 2.0.8
* OS/161 2.0.2
  * Binutils 2.24+os161-2.1
  * GCC 4.8.3+os161-2.1
  * GDB 7.8+os161-2.1

These packages are downloaded from the [official Harvard
sources][161-download].

## Quick start

### Intel

With [Homebrew] installed, run

```bash
$ brew tap liamolucko/os161
$ brew install os161-toolchain
```

then follow the standard OS/161 spinup guide.

### Apple Silicon

Installing on Apple Silicon is a bit tricker, because GCC and GDB don't support it[^1]. That means that you need to install the Intel versions.

To do that, you can install an Intel version of Homebrew alongside your Apple Silicon version, by adding `arch -x86_64` to the start of the regular Homebrew installer:

```bash
$ arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then you can follow the same instructions as for Intel machines, but using the absolute path of Intel Homebrew (since you've probably left Apple Silicon Homebrew as first in your `PATH`):

```bash
$ /usr/local/bin/brew tap liamolucko/os161
$ /usr/local/bin/brew install os161-toolchain
```

`os161-binutils` and `sys161` work just fine on Apple Silicon though, so feel free to install those using normal Homebrew and only use the Intel version for `os161-gcc` and `os161-gdb`.

[^1]: [There are patches to get GCC working][gcc-patches], which Homebrew automatically uses and so `brew install gcc` works fine; however, they only go down to GCC 6, and OS/161 uses GCC 4. GDB doesn't work at all.

## Detailed installation instructions

If you're using Apple Silicon, follow the above instructions to install Intel Homebrew and then replace `brew` with `/usr/local/bin/brew` in all these commands.

### Homebrew tap

Install Homebrew from http://brew.sh if you don't have it already.
Then, add this repository as a [custom tap] so Homebrew can find the
OS161-specific formula:

```bash
$ brew tap liamolucko/os161
```

### System/161

First, install the System/161 MIPS simulator.

```bash
$ brew install sys161
```

At this point, `sys161` will be available in your PATH and runnable. A
sample `sys161.conf` is installed to:

    /usr/local/share/examples/sys161/sys161.conf.sample


### GCC

Then, you need a cross-compiling GCC capable of building executables for
System/161:

```bash
$ brew install os161-gcc
```

This will install a GCC toolchain prefixed with `mips-harvard-os161-`
into your PATH. This means that directly invoking GCC is rather
annoying, as `mips-harvard-os161-gcc` is a lot to type. You'll rarely
need to invoke the compiler directly, though; the OS/161 Makefiles will
do this for you.


### GDB

You'll almost certainly want a GDB capable of debugging executables
built for System/161:

```bash
$ brew install os161-gdb
```

This installs `mips-harvard-os161-gdb`. Since you'll be invoking this
command manually quite a bit, this automatically installs a shorter
alias, `os161-gdb`.


## OS/161

To set up stock OS/161 in a nutshell:

```bash
# Obtain sources
$ wget http://os161.eecs.harvard.edu/download/os161-base-2.0.3.tar.gz
$ tar xf os161-base-2.0.3.tar.gz

# Build userland
$ cd os161-base-2.0.3
$ ./configure
$ bmake
$ bmake install

# Build kernel
$ cd kern/conf
$ ./config DUMBVM
$ cd ../compile/DUMBVM
$ bmake depend
$ bmake
$ bmake install

# Run kernel
$ cd ~/os161/root
$ cp /usr/local/share/examples/sys161/sys161.conf.sample sys161.conf
$ sys161 kernel
```
